Project Overview

The Daily Calorie Tracker is a simple Python-based CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that helps students and users track their daily calorie intake. Users can:

Log meals and their calorie values.

Calculate total and average calories consumed.

Compare against a personal daily calorie limit.

Receive warnings if the daily limit is exceeded.

Save session summaries to a text file for future reference.


This project helps beginners practice Python input/output, lists, arithmetic, conditional statements, string formatting, and file handling.
